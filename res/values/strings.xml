	Thank you install and use the software in this section!
	The software in the form of pictures shows the method of their tie shoes.
	I hope it can help you.
	</string>
	<string name="criss">\r
	    This is probably the most \n 
	    common method of lacing \n
	    normal shoes boots. The \n
		laces simply criss cross as\n
		they work theirway up the \n
		shoe. \n
		♥ Traditional look\n
		♥ Simple to lace\n
		♥ Comfortable\n
		</string>

	<string name="doublebacklacing">\r
		This method looks \n
		interesting plus holds very \n
		firmly, but is terribly\n
		awkward to tighten.The\n
		lacing first runs down the\n
		shoe,then doubles back up\n
		the shoe.\n
		♥ Stays very tight\n
		♥ Terribly awkward\n
	</string>
	<string name="ladderlacin">\r
	    This distinctive lacing is \n
		worn on military boots by \n
		paratroopers and\n
		ceremonial guard units. The\n
		laces weave horizontally\n
		and vertically,forming \n
		a secure "ladder".\n
		♥ Distinctive look\n
		♥ Stays very tight\n
		 </string>
	<string name="sawtoothlacing">\r
		This method has all of the \n
		underlying sections pulling \n
		at a steep angle, which shifts\n
		the alignment of the sides\n
		and may correct an \n
		otherwise ill-fitting shoe.\n
		♥ Easier to tighten\n
		♥ Modifies fit \n</string>
	<string name="spiderweblacing">\r
		Like an angled version of \n
		Ladder Lacing,this\n
		decorative method is also \n
		worn on military boots. The \n
		laces weave vertically and \n
		diagonally, forming an \n
		intricate "web".\n 
		♥ Decorative look\n
		♥ Firm and tight\n
		</string>
	<string name="straighteasylacing">\r
		This is a simplified variation\n
		of Straight(Bar)Lacing where\n
		one end runs straight from \n
		bottom to top whilst v the \n
		other end steps through the\n
		eyelets.\n
		♥ Even number of eyelet \n
		♥ pairs = Neat look
		</string>
	<string name="straighteuropeanlacing">\r
		This traditional method of \n
		Straight Lacing appears to\n
		be more common in Europe\n
		The laces run straight \n
		across on the outside and \n
		diagonally on the inside.\n
		♥ Neat on top</string>
	<string name="straightbarlacing">\r
	    This variation of Straight \n
	    Lacing eliminates the \n
	    underlying diagonals, which \n
	    looks neater plus relieves \n
	    pressure on the top ridge \n
	    of the foot.\n
	    ♥ Comfortable\n
	    ♥ Neat look\n
	</string>
	<string name="traintracktacing">\r
		Like Army Lacing with the\n
		inside segments running\n
		straight across, the result\n
		looks like train tracks,and\n
		holds very tight because of\n
		the doubled laces through\n
		eyelets.\n
		♥ Neat look\n
		♥ Holds very tight</string>
	<string name="zipperlacin">\r
		This method locks the laces\n
		at each eyelet pair.Great \n
		for lacing skates tightly\n
		because the lower sections\n
		hold while tightening. It\n
		also looks interesting,a \n
		bit like a giant zipper.\n
		♥ Decorative look\n
		♥ Holds very firmly
	</string>
	<string name="overunder">\r
		This method reduces friction,\n
		making the lacing easier to\n
		tighten and loosen plus \n
		reducing wear and tear. \n
		The laces alternate between\n
		crossing Over and Under.\n
		♥ Decorative look \n
		♥ Faster and easier \n
		♥ Less wear and tear \n
	</string>
	<string name="hiking">\r
		An inside-out version of \n
		Straight (Bar) Lacing, which \n
		distributes pressure evenly \n
		plus keeps the knots and \n
		ends to the side.\n
		♥ Evens out pressure \n
		♥ Reduces snagging \n
	</string>
	<string name="shoeshop">\r
	    Often seen in shoe shops \n
	    because  many shoes come \n
	    pre-laced this way from \n
	    the factory. One end \n
		runs from bottom to top \n
		while the other end \n
		zig-zags through\n
		the eyelets.\n
		♥ Easy to lace \n
	</string>
	<string name="displayshoe">\r
	    Shoe stores and \n
	    photographers often use \n
	    this inside-out version\n
		of Criss Cross Lacing on \n
		their display shoes in order \n
		to finish with the ends \n
		neatly hidden inside shoe.\n 
		♥ Tidy look \n
		♥ Easier to loosen \n
	</string>
	<string name="bowtie">\r
		This method "lengthens" ends \n
		because it consumes the \n
		least amount of shoelace. \n
		The laces cross over on the \n
		outside and run vertically \n
		on the inside, forming a \n
		"bow-tie" outline. \n
		♥ Minimal look \n
		♥ Comfort "zones" \n
	</string>
	<string name="army">\r
		This inside-out version of \n
		Bow Tie Lacing is used on \n
		combat boots by various \n
		armies.With the crossovers \n
		on the insides, the sides \n
		of the boots can flex \n
		more easily. \n
		♥ Allows more flex \n
	</string>
	<string name="doublehelix">\r
		This patented method has \n
		the laces angled one way \n
		on the outside and the \n
		other way on the inside. \n
		♥ Decorative look \n
		♥ Fast and easy \n
		♥ Less wear and tear\n
	</string>
	<string name="doublecross">\r
		This lacing is created by \n
		running three steps forward \n
		(on the inside),one step back \n
		(on the outside). The result is \n
		short, wide crosses overlapping \n
		tall, narrow crosses. \n
		♥ Decorative look \n
	</string>
	<string name="hash">\r
		Like Double Cross Lacing, \n
		this method is also created \n
		by running three steps \n
		forward,one step back. \n
		The result resembles \n
		a diagonal series of hash \n
		"#" symbols.\n
		♥ Decorative look \n
	</string>
	<string name="lattice">\r
		This very popular method \n
		forms a decorative lattice \n
		in the middle of the \n
		lacing. The laces are \n
		crossed at a steep angle, \n
		allowing them to be woven \n
		through each other.\n
		♥ Decorative look \n
	</string>
	<string name="riddingboot">\r
		This method is for riding \n
		boots (motorbike or \n
		equestrian) that are joined \n
		at the top and that loosen \n
		near the ankle. The laces \n
		zig-zag from both ends and \n
		are tied in the middle. \n
		♥ Neat look \n
		♥ Unusual layout \n
	</string>
	<string name="onehand">\r
		As an alternative to the One \n
		Handed Shoelace Knot, this \n
		way of lacing eliminates \n
		the need to even tie a knot \n
		by leaving one end loose. \n
		♥ Disabled use \n
		♥ Surprisingly easy \n
	</string>
	<string name="segmented">\r
		This variation divides the \n
		lacing into two or more \n
		"segments", each of which \n
		can be laced up as tightly or \n
		loosely as necessary to \n
		achieve a comfortable yet \n
		fit for difficult shoes  \n
		♥ Customizable \n
		♥ Many uses \n
	</string>
	<string name="knottedsegment">\r
		A more attractive though \n
		less flexible variation \n
		of Segmented Lacing in \n
		which a knot makes the \n
		lower segment of shoelace \n
		permanently tighter or \n
		looser. \n
		♥ Customizable \n
		♥ Many uses \n
	</string>
	<string name="hiddenknot">\r
		By hiding the knot \n
		underneath, the result \n
		is an uninterrupted \n
		series of straight \n
		"bars" that looks \n
		particularly distinctive \n
		on dress shoes or \n
		sneakers alike. \n
		♥ Distinctive look \n
	</string>
	<string name="loopback">\r
		Each side loops back on \n
		itself down the middle, \n
		rather like when two \n
		springs become intertwined. \n
		However, those loop-backs \n
		tend to shift off-centre. \n
		♥ Decorative look \n
	</string>
	<string name="knotted">\r
		Adding an overhand knot at \n
		each crossover increases \n
		friction and keeps the \n
		lacing much firmer. Ideal \n
		for tightening ice skates, \n
		rollerblades, etc. \n
		♥ Keeps lacing tight \n
		♥ Assists tightening \n
	</string>
	<string name="twistie">\r
		Like a combination of Loop \n
		Back and Knotted Lacing, \n
		the laces are twisted \n
		together with a vertical \n
		overhand knot at each \n
		crossover before continuing \n
		to the other side. \n
		♥ Decorative look \n
		♥ Keeps lacing tight \n
	</string>
	<string name="roman">\r
		Alternating X-I-X-I on top of \n
		the shoe, which looks a little \n
		like Roman numerals. It is \n
		most effective on dress \n
		shoes  where the sides of the\n
		shoe meet in the middle.\n
		♥ Decorative look \n
		♥ Suits dress shoes \n
	</string>
	<string name="hexagram">\r
		This purely decorative lacing \n
		forms a hexagram, or six \n
		pointed star. This geometric \n
		symbol has been used for \n
		centuries in various cultures \n
		and religions, most notably\n
		as the Jewish "Star of David".\n
		♥ Decorative look \n
	</string>
	<string name="pentagram">\r
		This purely decorative lacing \n
		forms a pentagram, or five \n
		pointed star. Besides the \n
		"magical" associations, solid \n
		five pointed stars are found \n
		on many flags, most notably \n
		the fifty stars on the U.S. \n
		flag. \n
		♥Decorative look \n
	</string>
	<string name="asterisk">\r
		Lacing sets of three eyelet \n
		pairs with a crossover plus \n
		a straight section results \n
		in a series of asterisk * \n
		symbols. Best on shoes with \n
		multiples of three eyelet \n
		pairs (3, 6, 9, etc). \n
		♥ Decorative look \n
	</string>
	<string name="starburst">\r
		With all vertical segments \n
		hidden on the inside and all \n
		diagonal segments on the \n
		outside crossing at the \n
		middle of the shoe, the \n
		result looks like a \n
		Starburst. \n
		♥ Decorative look \n
		♥ Top opens wide \n
	</string>
	<string name="supernova">\r
		Like two Starbursts on top\n
		of each other, one on the \n
		outside, the other on the \n
		inside. Needs the maximum \n
		length of shoelace and is \n
		useful for "shortening" \n
		long laces. \n
		♥ Decorative look \n
		♥ Top opens wide \n
	</string>
	<string name="footbag">\r
		Footbag players use this \n
		lacing to open up the \n
		front of their shoes, \n
		making it easier to \n
		catch or otherwise \n
		control the footbag \n
		(or "Hacky Sack"). \n
		♥ Suits Footbag \n
	</string>
	<string name="lock">\r
		Not a lacing method as \n
		much as a technique for \n
		creating a super-tight \n
		finish. It is often \n
		recommended for lacing\n
		running shoes to help \n
		prevent heel slippage\n
		♥ Tightens firmly \n
		♥ Reduces slippage \n
	</string>
	
	
	
	<string name="doublebacklacing_use">

	<string name="criss_detail">
	1. The lace is run straight across the bottom (grey section) and the ends are fed in through both bottom eyelets.\n

	1. The lace is run straight across (grey section) and the ends are fed in through the second set of eyelets from the top.\n
	2. The ends are crossed over each other, then fed in through the second-lower set of eyelets down the shoe (skip past one set of eyelets).\n
	3. Repeat step (2), criss-crossing down the shoe two sets of eyelets at a time.\n
	4. At the bottom, run each lace end vertically between the bottom and second from bottom eyelets.\n

	3. The ends are crossed over and are fed under the vertical lace sections on the opposite sides of the shoe before continuing straight up and feeding into the next set of eyelets up the shoe.\n
	4. At the top set of eyelets, the laces can once again cross over and pass under the straight section as shown. This not only looks consistent with the rest of the lacing but also forms a High Lace Lock, which tightens the lacing even more firmly.\n
